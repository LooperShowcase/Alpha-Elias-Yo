        Marie Curie Marie Salomea Skłodowska
        was a Polish and
        naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering
        research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,
        the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win
        a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields

        Early years

Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski.[14] The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia), Józef [pl] (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born 1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).[15][16]

On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863–65).[17] This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.[17] Maria's paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski [pl], had been principal of the Lublin primary school attended by Bolesław Prus,[18] who became a leading figure in Polish literature.[19]

Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia (secondary schools) for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his children in its use.[15] He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.[15] Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.[15] She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old.[15] Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder.[15] Maria's father was an atheist, her mother a devout Catholic.[20] The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.[21]

When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next, she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.[14] After a collapse, possibly due to depression,[15] she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.[14] Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.[14][15]
